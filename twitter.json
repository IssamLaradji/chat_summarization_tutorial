When did you first notice that the two devices were not talking to each other. Do the two devices communicate through other apps such as Messages?\n\tCustomer:\t@AppleSupport Yes, everything seems fine, it\u2019s just Health and activity.\n\tAgent:\t@135060 Let\u2019s move to DM and look into this a bit more. When reaching out in DM, let us know when this first started happening please. For example, did it start after an update or after installing a certain app? https://t.co/GDrqU22YpT\n",

We can't guarantee we can do anything, as your bag arrived on the carousel. However, please DM us your baggage ref, email and postal address. ^Leanne\n\tCustomer:\t@British_Airways Hi Leanne I've sent the message thanks Dan\n",

        "8ecb6cbae489e89d6d56e15608f95c8a\n\tCustomer:\t@SW_Help the 2120 Salisbury train from Waterloo. Not really getting much info guys....\n\tCustomer:\t@SW_Help So it was incorrectly coupled?? Really???? Your driver decoupled and recoupled it and the doors \"magically worked\". Serious breach in protocol there guys. Playing with safety because previous driver wanted to clock out.\n\tAgent:\t@182172 On occasion the electrical contacts that the trains use to pass communications for door controls, power and brake, information systems, etc will not make contact properly. In these cases, detaching and reattaching is the approved process taken in line with our fleet 1/3\n\tAgent:\t@182172 team's fault-finding instructions, and done under the instruction of maintenance staff and the fleet control manager. The train's fail-safe systems would not allow it to move in this situation, and if we could not resolve the problem, the train would be taken out of service. 2/3\n\tAgent:\t@182172 Safety is, and always will be, our first priority, and in this case protocols were followed correctly. Our fleet team will investigate using on-board monitoring systems as to what when wrong in this case and take appropriate action. ^DB 3/3\n\tCustomer:\t@SW_Help So wait a second. Once a driver couples the train it's not protocol to test immediately, but to wait until the carriages are full of passengers to then couple? That's your statement?\n\tAgent:\t@182172 On more modern stock the train will undertake the necessary tests to confirm. With older trains, there is a \"pull-away\" test to confirm the trains are physically coupled together, but it is not always immediately apparent that the all of the 100+ contacts on the train 1/3\n\tAgent:\t@182172 type in question are making suitable contact. Any one of these pins not making proper contact can result in the train not being able to move as part of fail-safe systems built in. As mentioned, more modern trains such as our 450 and 444 types have computer systems on board 2/3\n\tAgent:\t@182172 which test each signal passing through the contacts to confirm that the train is attached both physically and electronically. ^DB 3/3\n\tCustomer:\t@SW_Help Whilst I'm still shocked, I appreciate the fullness of the answer! :)\n\tAgent:\t@182172 No worries - I'm ex train-crew, so this is rather my specialist topic! Appreciate that it seems a little antiquated, but it's all vetted and okayed by the safety bodies. It's similar to the modern trains, where resolving problems can often come down to turning off the 1/2\n\tAgent:\t@182172 train's management systems and turning them back on again! ^DB 2/2\n\tCustomer:\t@SW_Help Ahh that makes sense, thought the response was a little more detailed than usual. As a regular passenger I like understanding more, helps me to work around problems and know when to make alternative plans. It's amazing how often turning it off and on again actually works\n\tAgent:\t@182172 I always try to give something a bit more detailed, running a railway often has a lot more to it than it appears (I was recently conversing with @20997 about emissions standards, which was an interesting research topic). Benefits of 6 years experience though! ^DB\n\tCustomer:\t@SW_Help Keep up the good work!\n",

Even if the airport is quiet, check in times still need to be met. ^Natalie\n\tCustomer:\t@British_Airways Natalie I was 5min late. Plane wasn't expected to leave for 55min, airport was empty, pretty sure security would be too, (would guess the plane was too)I'm confident I could have made it to the gate with ample time, with just a tiny bit of your help.\n\tAgent:\t@223071 Hi Thamin, I'm afraid this isn't something we can offer any flexibility with. It's not possible to check in for a flight after check in closes, as the system doesn't allow it. Late arrivals can cause flight delays and we apply the same policy to everyone, not just when it's 1/2\n\tAgent:\t@223071 busy. I can understand your disappointment, but it's your responsibility to arrive at the airport in good time and complete check in before it closes. ^Beth S. 2/2\n\tCustomer:\t@British_Airways Just for clarification \ud83e\udd14- so you never allow anyone and have allowed in the past people that are late for checkin? Could you kindly direct me to this policy too please.\n\tCustomer:\t@British_Airways And are you sure Beth that the system does not allow you to do late check-ins?\n\tAgent:\t@223071 We're sorry, Thamim. If you follow this link, it does advise you https://t.co/77ypcUvLtx. Click check in essentials. It is your responsibility to arrive at the airport with enough time.\n\tCustomer:\t@British_Airways You've not answered all my questions - I take my responsibility for being 5min late, but your staff could have easily (assessed it's not busy and) check me in.\n\tAgent:\t@223071 We appreciate the points you've raised, Thamim. However, once check in has been closed, we're unable to reopen a passenger list. We hope you understand we have to be fair and consistent with all of our passengers. 1/2\n\tAgent:\t@223071 This means our staff wouldn't have been able to make an exception when you travelled. We hope this message helps to clarify our position. 2/2 ^DaniH\n\tCustomer:\t@British_Airways Thank you for the response- but it doesn't suffice and is unacceptable, you're flights are always delayed and customers get no compensation. You also make different exceptions for different people it seems\n\tAgent:\t@223071 EU compensation depends on the reason for a delay or cancellation, Thamim. Not all flights are eligible as not all reasons are under our control. We're sorry you remain disappointed, however, as previously advised it's your responsibility to make sure you arrive at the 1/2\n\tAgent:\t@223071 airport and check in, in time for your flight. We're unable to hold a flight for a passenger if they are late. Our position remains unchanged. ^Natalie 2/2\n\tCustomer:\t@British_Airways Natalie - do me favour, let's quantify this: how long on average it takes to get from checkin desk to the furthest boarding gates at T5?\n\tCustomer:\t@British_Airways And for the record I wasn't asking you to hold a flight, the plane wasn't due to leave for 50min (and it was still delayed by 20min)\n\tAgent:\t@223071 Hi Thamin. It can depend on a lot of factors. We appreciate you may not have been asking to hold the flight. If you're late to check in, there isn't any way for you to make the flight, even if the flight is delayed. We're sorry you remain disappointed with our response. ^Paul\n",

I asked to move ahead in the long line. Your rep looked at me and watched the clock change from 6:15 to 6:16\n\tCustomer:\t@Delta @824 He then told me too bad to rebook. I was in line at 6am. Flight left at 7. He said \u201cI\u2019m helping you\u201d-Then the rep said it\u2019s $1000 to rebook\n\tCustomer:\t@Delta @824 How is that helping?!? This man was awful to me. How can you employ people like this? Does loyalty no longer matter?\n\tAgent:\t@353791 Loyalty does matter, and I am sorry that you feel you were treated badly. I am showing from the timestamps in your reservation that... 1/2\n\tAgent:\t@353791 ...you did check in late. I do apologize. I am also showing that you were rebooked to the next flight at no cost. *TBW 2/2\n\tCustomer:\t@Delta They did finally rebook. We were charged $75 per ticket. So $150. And I had to leave my $200 luggage at ticketing.\n\tCustomer:\t@Delta Still dragging a trashbag of all my belongings.\n\tAgent:\t@353791 I am truly sorry for your experience today. *TBW\n\tCustomer:\t@Delta Also had to throw away $40 in toiletries I would\u2019ve checked but couldn\u2019t carry on. So a $400 loss. And running thru JFK. With a trashbag\n\tCustomer:\t@Delta Late bc my husband got stuck at security. And I was busy emptying and leaving behind my luggage that #delta wouldn\u2019t check #awfulairline\n\tCustomer:\t@Delta How are you SHOWING that loyalty matters when you charge us even though your employees were unbelievably rude? Words don\u2019t matter.\n\tCustomer:\t@Delta Sorry doesn\u2019t help. A new luggage helps bc now I don\u2019t have one. A credit back for the $150 rebooking fee helps.\n\tAgent:\t@353791 Angela, regretfully, as the charges show to be accurate, I cannot offer a refund or new luggage. I am only able to offer my apologies. *TBW\n\tCustomer:\t@Delta Well don\u2019t lie on Twitter and say I wasn\u2019t charged WHEN I WAS. #Liars Where\u2019s the corporate responsibility #delta?\n",

I didnt know you guys were still doing that or doing it period\n\tAgent:\t@697992 Thanks for your patience.

What's does that mean and how do I upgrade seats. That's the whole reason I tweeted you. Cmon Delta aka *HML\n\tAgent:\t@697992 Freddie, in order upgrade your ticket to First Class, you must pay the difference in the fare. In reviewing your ticket, you have no value left to apply towards the cost of the ticket to upgrade. *HML\n\tAgent:\t@697992 If you're using miles to upgrade, the cost is 35,000 miles each way and you must be booked in a L, U, or T class fare. *HML\n\tCustomer:\t@Delta What do mean I must pay the difference but then say I have no value left in my ticket? Why not just tell me how much it is to upgrade like I've been asking from the beginning? What does it mean I have no value in a tix I purchased?\n\tAgent:\t@697992 To make changes to your reservation there is a change fee of $200.00. Your ticket is less than the change fee; therefore, there is no value in your ticket. I can provide an estimated cost to change your ticket; however, this does not include taxes and fees. *HML\n\tAgent:\t@697992 The estimated cost is $1,500.00 for First Class on your flight from EWR to GCM. This does not include taxes and airport fees and fares are not guaranteed until purchased. Please contact our International Reservation specialist at 1-800-241-4141. *HML\n",

We have to wait for the packages to be released, the same as the customers. ^E.W. https://t.co/wKJHDXWGRQ\n\tCustomer:\t@UPSHelp So it\u2019s been over 24 hours. Still no delivery estimate and no progress. What is going on with this shipment?\n\tCustomer:\t@UPSHelp Package was released over 48 hours ago. Still hasn\u2019t moved. Delivery was scheduled for today, 11/21. @AppleSupport https://t.co/mqiFzgGzML\n\tAgent:\t@422109 The package has been cleared, but has not resumed transit. Once it does, we will be able to have the package sent to the destination facility for delivery to you. We understand the importance of your package and appreciate your patience. ^TT\n\tCustomer:\t@UPSHelp But my question is WHY hasn\u2019t it resumed transit. No one has been able to answer this question for two days. Not helpful at all. @AppleSupport\n\tAgent:\t@422109 There is an Iphone hold up currently. If you do not want to wait I would advise contacting the shipper to see if there is another way you can possibly get it. ^LD https://t.co/wKJHDXWGRQ\n\tCustomer:\t@UPSHelp This is response I got from @AppleSupport chat: I do not know why they referred you to us when they have your package and have access to whats going on with it. All of the shipping information that we provided to customers comes from UPS so they should have helped you with that.\n\tAgent:\t@422109 Our records indicate the package is in the process of being released by customs. We have no control on how long this can take, however, the package delivery date will be updated once the package is released. Please continue to track at https://t.co/5oMU69kAgc.\n\tCustomer:\t@UPSHelp Your tracking page says \u201cClearance completed.\u201d It has since 11/19, 2 days ago. What is the discrepancy in your system?\n\tAgent:\t@422109 The package was released on Sunday, 11/19/17, however, the package can move without being scanned. The package still needs to reach the destination. Typically the scheduled delivery date would be today, 11/21, however, it has been delayed due to customs. ^TV\n\tCustomer:\t@UPSHelp Man, you guys keep telling me different things. Now the package can move without being scanned? What a joke. An absolute joke.\n\tCustomer:\t@UPSHelp I didn\u2019t think there was a way for UPS to screw up my delivery any more ways, but you have proven me wrong.\n\tAgent:\t@422109 I show that this package has been requested to be held for pickup. Please DM us if anything further is needed. ^RF\n\tCustomer:\t@UPSHelp Yes because for some reason the driver thought a signature was required, even though the shipper did not request that. So I\u2019ll go pick it up myself since you\u2019re not capable of delivering it.\n",

Are you actively seeking to put those of us who have spent hundreds of our hard-earned shekels on your hardware off using it?\n\tAgent:\t@276839 Hello! It's our pleasure to assist you, Mark. Did you receive an error message? Let us know so we can help you further.\n\tCustomer:\t@MicrosoftHelps Getting no error message and no acknowledgement of the files on the SD card. Nothing at all happening. This is only the Mobile version of Groove; the Desktop version is fine. I gather the issue is the library cache being gummed with old data and needs clearing (1/2)\n\tCustomer:\t@MicrosoftHelps (2/2) but I don't have the permissions to wipe the relevant %localappdata% subdir like on Desktop, and I am *not* prepared to hard reset my device. I either want access to %localappdata% or I want this bug to be fixed (this century, preferably).\n\tCustomer:\t@MicrosoftHelps Closest I can get is to this nonsense here - option greyed out and no apparent way of changing that. Bet there's no code behind that button! https://t.co/hj2ToaKCYG\n\tAgent:\t@276839 Let's fix this. We suggest that you check the app updates. From app list, go to Microsoft Store &gt; Menu &gt; Downloads and updates &gt; Get updates. Refer to this link for more info: https://t.co/cbsWoxsaeZ.\n\tCustomer:\t@MicrosoftHelps Done this.\n\tCustomer:\t@MicrosoftHelps Moved files to a different path on SD card, *some* has been added. A number of albums, however, haven't been added to my library. I know this isn't a support issue directly, it's just a badly written app but Feedback have been ignoring me from the start.\n\tAgent:\t@276839 In that case, we suggest that you get in touch with our Answer Desk support for more in-depth troubleshooting. You may contact them on this link: https://t.co/j9LMM5VUNf.\n\tAgent:\t@276839 Hi, Mark. How's everything? Please let us know more about your experience here:\u00a0https://t.co/uDUrfXRyZU.\n\tCustomer:\t@MicrosoftHelps SD card support in W10 Mobile is broken. I don't want support, I want the issued fixed where they're happening. Pls forward to the dev team.\n\tAgent:\t@276839 Just to verify, were you able to contact Answer Desk and get a Service Request number? So we can escalate this case to our Tier 3 team. You can reply through this link: https://t.co/3qcAsLFkaY\n\tCustomer:\t@MicrosoftHelps Why? This is clearly a bug, not a support issue.\n\tAgent:\t@276839 You may share your feedback through our Feedback hub link: https://t.co/zyaysR7L8O. This will greatly help our Engineers to investigate this matter.\n\tCustomer:\t@MicrosoftHelps I have, feedback consistently ignored. Are you even reading the thread?\n",

Just so you\u2019re aware, Opera isn\u2019t a supported browser for... 1/2\n\tAgent:\t@391961 ...Dropbox.com. You can see the supported browsers at the following page: https://t.co/dbZ6rlRtkS 2/2\n\tCustomer:\t@DropboxSupport It's obvious Opera isn't supported. Don't hide behind this excuse, it's not the 90s anymore: 'best viewed in Netscape'. The prob != Opera\u2026\n\tCustomer:\t@DropboxSupport as U2F works perfectly with Google and Github in Opera. SMS is 2FA insecure, unreliable and cumbersome. It rarely works where I live.\n\tCustomer:\t@DropboxSupport FYI simply changing user agent in Opera to Chrome allows U2F logins on Dropbox. This doesn't take months to add, or require special support.\n\tCustomer:\t@DropboxSupport And finally, Firefox _is_ a supported browser but U2F logins don't work on Dropbox, whereas they work on Github.\n\tAgent:\t@391961 Hi again, can you let us know which OS are you using? Please DM us details so we can further look into this! Thanks!\n",

What info would they have to give?\n\tAgent:\t@809087 That would depend on their reason for calling. If they're having service related issues they may not need to provide much account details. However, this would be at the discretion of the representative they speak with. The contact telephone number is 866.243.9787. ^AP .\n\tCustomer:\t@Ask_Spectrum Is it 24/7? You do understand that discretion of the representative is not what a renter who has paid good money to enjoy vacation wants to hear.

We don't look to reduce flights as we know that takes travel options away, but we do look at available options and workarounds... 1/2\n\tCustomer:\t@JetBlue And what is the workaround that has been put into place for this contingency?

Also something not communicated to passengers.\n\tAgent:\t@503116 We understand this experience at the airport was not ideal. We appreciate you taking the time to share this feedback with us.\n",
